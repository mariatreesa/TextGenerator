Text Generator
========

This is done as part of Python course at Link√∂ping University.

The repository contains a command line script to read the file and print basic information abou the content
such as frequency table f alphabetic letters, number of words that text contains according to some definition of word,
Unique words in text, 5 most commonly used words etc. 

The code also writes the about information to a text file according based on a flag. 

The second script, generate_scipt.py which takes a filename of a text file, starting word and number of words as inputs and 
generates a text where the rule is 'the likelihood of the next word' is obtained from text file and most likely
word is appended.
